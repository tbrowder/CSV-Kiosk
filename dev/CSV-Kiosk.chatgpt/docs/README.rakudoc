=TITLE CSV::Kiosk (ChatGPT edition)

=head1 Overview
A simple kiosk-style CSV entry tool with reporting utilities.

=head1 Features
* Interactive loop: keep the program open while people enter data sequentially.
* Backup: timestamped CSV backup on each session start.
* Input hygiene: trims whitespace; strips quotes; replaces commas with " / " to avoid quoted CSV fields.
* Duplicate detection: warns and skips exact duplicate rows.
* Reports:
  * Sort in-place by a named field (default first field).
  * Generate a simple two-column PDF list (first column as display).

=head1 Install
```
zef install .
```

=head1 Usage

```

=head2 PDF list

=head1 Notes
* CSV must have a header row.
* PDF list uses the first field of each row as its display text.
* This distro prefers unquoted fields by sanitizing commas/quotes from input.
